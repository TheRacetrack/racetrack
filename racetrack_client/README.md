# Racetrack CLI client
`racetrack-client` is a CLI client tool for deploying and managing workloads in Racetrack.

Racetrack system allows to deploy jobs in a one step.
It transforms your code to in-operation workloads, e.g. Kubernetes workloads.
You write some code according to a set of coventions, you include the manifest file which explains the code, 
and you submit it to Racetrack. A short while after, the service calling your code is in operation.

## Quickstart
```shell
# Install racetrack-client
python3 -m pip install --upgrade racetrack-client

# Set current remote
racetrack set remote https://racetrack.platform.example.com

# Log in with token
racetrack login T0k3n.g0es.H3r3
# Or log in with username
racetrack login --username admin

# Deploy a Job
racetrack deploy
```

## Installation
Install racetrack-client using pip:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade racetrack-client
```

Python 3.8 (or higher) is required.

This will install `racetrack` CLI tool. Verify installation by running `racetrack` command.

## Usage
Run `racetrack --help` to see usage.

### Adding a remote
Assuming your Racetrack server is running on https://racetrack.platform.example.com/lifecycle,
you can add this remote as an alias:
```shell
racetrack set alias my-dev https://racetrack.platform.example.com/lifecycle
```

Alias is a short, friendly name for the URL of your Racetrack server, which is also known as "remote".
From now on, you can refer to your remote with an alias.

### Switching remotes
Set your current remote with:
```shell
racetrack set remote my-dev
```
This will set up a "remote" context for later use.

### Logging in
Log in to Racetrack with your user account (you can get your token from the Dashboard's profile page):
```shell
racetrack login T0k3n.g0es.H3r3
```

Alternatively, command `racetrack login --username <username>` allows you to log in with your username and password
(entered into the standard input) and saves the auth token without having to visit the Dashboard page.

In case you're going to use a private repository, provide your git credentials so the job can be built from your code:
```shell
racetrack set credentials https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepository USERNAME TOKEN
```

### Installing plugins
Extend Racetrack's possibilities by installing a bunch of plugins:
```shell
# This plugin allows you to deploy jobs written in Python
racetrack plugin install github.com/TheRacetrack/plugin-python-job-type

# This plugin allows you to deploy jobs to a local Docker infrastructure
racetrack plugin install github.com/TheRacetrack/plugin-docker-infrastructure
```

Plugins can only be installed by admin users.

### Deploying a job
When your code is ready and you pushed your changes to a repository, it's time to deploy it;
that means, upload it to Racetrack so it can become a proper running Job.

To deploy a job, just run it in the place where `job.yaml` is located:
```shell
cd MuffinDestroyer
racetrack deploy 
```

You will see the URL of your deployed job in the output.

### Listing jobs
You can see the list of all deployed jobs with a command:
```shell
racetrack list
```

### Checking runtime logs
Check the logs of a running job by means of:
```shell
racetrack logs MuffinDestroyer
```

### Deleting a job
Delete your running job with:
```shell
racetrack delete MuffinDestroyer
```

### Extra vars
Manifest values can be overriden with key-value pairs coming from a command line.
It doesn't modify actual file, but its one-time, in-memory version before submitting it.
Racetrack client has `--extra-vars KEY=VALUE` parameter (or `-e` in short)
that overwrites values found in YAML manifest.

- `KEY` is the name of field and it can contain dots to refer to a nested field, for example `git.branch=master`
- `VALUE` can be any YAML or JSON object.

Extra vars parameters can be used multiple times in one command.

Example:
```shell
racetrack deploy -e secret_runtime_env_file=.env.local -e git.branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

It makes CLI commands more script-friendly, so you can overwrite manifest without tracking changes in job.yaml file.  
Tip: Use `racetrack validate` command beforehand to make sure your final manifest is what you expected.

### Getting auth token
Command `racetrack get auth-token` prints out current auth token.
It can be used in CLI scripts: `curl -H "X-Racetrack-Auth: $(racetrack get auth-token)"`
