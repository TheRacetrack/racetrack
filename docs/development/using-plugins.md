- GitHub repository name (eg. `github.com/TheRacetrack/plugin-python-job-type`) -
  it takes the ZIP file from the latest release.
  Pay attention to omit `https://` part.
- GitHub repository name with version (eg. `github.com/TheRacetrack/plugin-python-job-type==2.4.0`) -
  it takes the ZIP file from the specific release.
  Pay attention to omit `https://` part.

For instance, use the following command to activate the latest python3 plugin on your local kind setup:
```
racetrack plugin install github.com/TheRacetrack/plugin-python-job-type http://localhost:7002
